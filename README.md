# Cafe-Management
The Cafe Delight project is a basic front-end application that simulates an order management system for a caf√©. The design includes separate sections for selecting Indian beverages like Masala Chai and Filter Coffee using radio buttons (single selection) and snack items such as Samosa and Pav Bhaji using checkboxes (multiple selections).
